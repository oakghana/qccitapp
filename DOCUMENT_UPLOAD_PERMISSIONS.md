# Document Upload Permissions - IT Documents & Reports

## Overview
This update enables non-Head Office IT Staff to upload documents and files in the IT Documents & Reports page while restricting Head Office IT Staff uploads to maintain proper access control.

## Who Can Upload

### ✅ Can Upload Documents:
- **Admin** - Full access to upload documents
- **IT Head** - Full access to upload documents
- **Regional IT Head** - Can upload documents for their region
- **IT Staff (Non-Head Office)** - Can upload documents if located at any branch/location except "Head Office"

### ❌ Cannot Upload Documents:
- **IT Staff at Head Office** - Restricted from uploading (contact IT Head)
- **Service Desk Staff** - No upload permissions
- **Other users** - No upload permissions

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
**File: `components/reports/pdf-uploads-dashboard.tsx`**
- Updated `canUpload` permission logic to include IT Staff with location check
- Added user role and location context to upload API calls
- Added helpful message for IT Staff without upload permissions

### Backend Changes
**File: `app/api/pdf-uploads/route.ts`**
- Added server-side permission validation in POST handler
- Validates user role and location to prevent Head Office IT Staff from uploading
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user lacks upload permissions
- Logs warnings for unauthorized upload attempts

## Permission Logic

```javascript
// Frontend Permission Check
canUpload = 
  - isAdmin OR
  - isITHead OR 
  - isRegionalITHead OR
  - (isITStaff AND userLocation does NOT contain "head")
```
