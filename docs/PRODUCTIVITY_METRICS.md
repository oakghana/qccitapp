# Staff Productivity Metrics System

## Overview
The productivity metrics system tracks and ranks IT staff performance based on task completion rates, on-time delivery, and completion speed.

## Features

### 1. Productivity Scoring Algorithm
The system calculates a comprehensive productivity score (0-100) for each staff member using three key metrics:

**Score Components:**
- **50%** - Task Completion Rate: (completed tasks / total tasks assigned) × 100
- **30%** - On-Time Completion Rate: (tasks completed within expected timeframe / completed tasks) × 100  
- **20%** - Speed Bonus: Bonus points for faster completion times

**Speed Bonus Tiers:**
- ≤3 days average completion: +20 points
- 3-5 days average completion: +10 points
- 5-7 days average completion: +5 points
- >7 days average completion: +0 points

### 2. Expected Completion Times by Priority
Tasks have different expected completion timeframes based on priority:
- **Critical**: 1 day
- **High**: 3 days
- **Medium**: 5 days
- **Low**: 10 days

Tasks completed within these timeframes count toward the on-time completion rate.

### 3. Performance Grading
Staff are assigned performance grades based on their productivity score:
- **Excellent**: Score ≥85
- **Good**: Score 70-84
- **Average**: Score 50-69
- **Below Average**: Score 30-49
- **Poor**: Score <30

### 4. Ranking System
Staff members are ranked from 1 (highest) to N (lowest) based on their productivity score. The top 3 performers are highlighted with trophy icons.
